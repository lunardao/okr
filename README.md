#  Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

> *There are so many people working so hard and achieving so little.*  
> &mdash;Andy Groove


An OKR is a management methodology that helps to ensure that the association focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the entire organization.

**Members are more connected to the organization, better engaged, focused and committed when:**

1. Have a clear idea of what the team aims to achieve 
2. Have well defined goals that are written down and shared freely
3. Understand the significance of the mission and their tasks 

**Goal setting isn’t bulletproof:** 

> When people have conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals, they become frustrated, cynical, and demotivated. An effective goal management system, an OKR system, link goals to a team’s broader mission. It respects targets and deadlines while adapting to circumstances. It promotes feedback and celebrates wins, large and small. Most importantly, it expands our limits. It moves us to strive for what might seem beyond our reach.

- One way to introduce OKRs is to have an organization collectively identify three or four top objectives to be achieved for the entire year.
- OKRs rely on taking high-level objectives and refine them for each specific area.
- OKRs can be used when collaborating with partners (developing OKR together).
- OKRs are reviewed per agreed period (1 month, per quartal, annually).
- OKRs are connected to the foundation of LunarDAO, and the following points are the basis to formulate the OKRs:
    - Mission
    - Vision
    - Values
    - Culture & Codex
    - Long-term goals
    - Yearly goals
    
**TL;DR:** 

OKRs define **WHAT** needs a special emphasis and **HOW** to evaluate it. Additionaly for that to be successful every member must well understand **WHY** (the philosophy) to take responsibility and initiative autonomously without a need of a top-down micromanagement. OKRs are a tool as well as a teaching system for everyone in the DAO.

## Objectives  

> An OBJECTIVE is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed, they’re a vaccine against fuzzy thinking and fuzzy execution.

**How objectives should look like:**

- Short description of what we want to achieve
- Concise and engaging for the team (so we remember it)

**Examples of high-level objectives:**

- Improve access to privacy and anonymity tools  
- Increase treasury  
- Scale community

## Key Results

> KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable.
> For example, *“We will achieve a certain OBJECTIVE as measured by the following KEY RESULTS. . . ."*

- Key results is way to measure progress of objectives
- Each objective has 2-5 key results
- Key result is NOT the action taken to achieve an objective, it is the measurement of progress. 

**Example**

If the objective is to Scale community:

***INCORRECT*** Key result description: Airdrop $LUNAR to 1000 accounts

***CORRECT*** Key result description:  
1. \# accounts on the forum  
2. \# of LIP submitted  
3. \# of accounts participating in voting

If the objective is to attract more interest for LunarDAO:

1. \# of followers on Twitter
2. \# of re-tweets of our posts
3. \# of positive comments on our twitter posts.

## OKRs Evaluation

> *It’s not a key result unless it has a number.*  
> &mdash;Marissa Mayer 

Evaluation of the key results means to see if the objectives are met - the answer is simply **YES** or **NO**.

> Either a key result’s requirements is met or not; there is no gray area, no room for doubt. At the end of the designated period, typically a quarter, it is easy to evaluate if the key results were fulfilled or not.  
\
> Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year or longer, key results evolve as the work progresses. Once they are all completed, the objective is necessarily achieved. (And if it isn’t, the OKR was poorly designed in the first place.)

## Setting Up OKRs

* OKRs shall not be top down defined
* An organization decides their top OKRs
* Media, Research, Community Management, Main Ops shall define their own OKRs
* OKRs are based on discussion and community feedback
* The high-level KRs become objectives of the executive committees, cells or individuals working in that field - they must themselves define their KRs to meet those objectives (high-level KRs).
* That means that OKRs are bottom-up & sideways discussion based on main organizational OKRs
* Objectives and key results might encompass close to a hundred percent of work output
* Stewards have day-to-day responsibilities organically falling under the OKRs but not listed (ie if a KR is to scale up TW follow up to 2k, to have daily engagement is not OKR listed, it's a task)

## Continuity & Long term evaluation

The OKRs will be shared in a github [repository](https://github.com/lunardao/okr) as archives. The OKRs for the current period will include:

1. The high-level & long term OKRs
2. The current OKRs for the given time period
3. The OKRs from the previous period with their evaluation (except the first one)

### Disclaimer

LunarDAO Stewards reserve the right to discuss and keep particularities of some OKRs closed in private. Particularly if such information could endanger the operation or identities of the DAO members, allies, partners or counterparties. LunarDAO core-team will share it's member size and operations, list the external task based works and include the exact proposed (via LIP) sum for defined time period, however the decisions on the distribution among the individual core-team members and anyone externally supporting the execution of the operations is to be discussed privately.
