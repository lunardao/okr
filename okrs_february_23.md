# LunarDAO Objectives & Key Results - February 2023

**Objective:**

Align all DAO parts to be ready for the genesis launch, no later than March 6th. As measured by 4 Key Results which further become Objectives for the executive groups.

**Key Results:**

1. Finished the DAO structure & Approval by the community
2. Grow our media presence
3. Scale up the community
4. Research & finalize proposals for the main primitives

As these KRs are clear, they are too high-level to evaluate, that's why they are seen as objectives and separated into tangible, lower-level KRs:
